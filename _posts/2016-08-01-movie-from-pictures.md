# Make a Movie from Pictures

If you have pictures that contain a date in the EXIF metadata I wrote a simple Python script that
will convert them into a video suitable for posting on YouTube.

Some of the configuration options include:

  * The amount of time each picture stays on screen.
  * A song to put as background music.
    * Frame rate is scaled so that all pictures appear within the length of the song.
  * The size of the video.
  * Whether to include the date each picture was taken on part of the video.
