## Football Stadiums

I have always been a sports fan in the United States.
Over the years I have been exposed to the other football (soccer) and love the idea of relegation.
I wondered why United States sports leagues do not use this concept, especially in light of all the recent
tanking to procure better draft picks.
This led me to wonder how so many teams could be supported in the English Premier League and I started thinking
about geography.
I wanted to know what it would look like if the stadiums of the EPL were moved to the United States.
So I wrote some Python code to help me figure it out.

All of the stadiums (not just the Premier league) would fit inside California and Nevada.
