I have been working in robotics since 2001 on many different types of vehicles.

My CV can be found at [denewiler.us/cv](http://denewiler.us/cv).

## Current

Currently working on large autonomous ground vehicles as shown by the
[New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/video/technology/100000003668539/navy-tests-autonomous-future.html).
I am responsible for testing and merging new features and improvements into the baseline configuration.

## Graduate School

During graduate school I worked on the [Stingray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYVhpFxxofE)
autonomous underwater vehicle. I was the software lead for several of the AUVSI underwater vehicle competitions.
Most of the code from that project is now hosted at [stingray-auv](https://github.com/UCSD-E4E/stingray-auv).

I finished my Master's degree in 2011. My thesis involved state estimation and model-based waypoint following for
small ground vehicles.
A complied version of my thesis is available at [denewiler.us/thesis.pdf](http://denewiler.us/thesis.pdf).
Source files for my thesis are on GitHub.

I wrote lecture notes in Latex (available on my GitHub page) for several courses:

  * [Parameter Estimation](http://denewiler.us/mae283_lectures.pdf)
  * [Optimal Control](http://denewiler.us/mae288a_lectures.pdf)
  * [Nonlinear Systems](http://denewiler.us/mae281a_lectures.pdf)

An [empty template](https://github.com/tdenewiler/coursenotes) for creating lecture notes is available as well.
